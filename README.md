The React Currency Converter is a web application that enables users to perform currency conversions from a set in game currency to a real-life currency. Originally, this was used to get currency conversions using the [API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/). With a simple and user-friendly interface, this app allows users to select to and from the "Game Currency" and "USD", specify the amount, and instantly get the converted result. This app provides a framework for in-game, real-time exchange rates, where a separate calculation can be made to alter exchange rates at different times. Imagine the possibilities! It is built using React, TypeScript, Bootstrap, and Moment libraries.

## Features

- Choose the currency to convert from a drop-down list.
- Select the currency to convert to from another drop-down list.
- Input the amount to be converted.
- Fetch the current exchange rate and get the converted amount.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript, adding type checking to your code.
- Bootstrap: CSS framework for responsive and visually appealing designs.
- Moment: JavaScript library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.
- Currency-flags: A library displaying currency flags. Used it in the dropdown.
